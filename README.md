In this small research project, we are trying to replicate the results of the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02036
In particular, we are focusing on its first example of a fully visible model with N=10 that allows us to confront the performance of classical Boltzmann Machines (BM), quantum BM and another variant called bQBM
