In this small research project, we try to replicate the results of the following paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02036.

 In particular, we focus on its first example (Section 4) of a fully visible model with N variables, this allows to confront the training of classical Boltzmann Machine (BM), Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) and another variant called bound-QBM.
